# test-app
This project is based entirely on the tutorial that can be found at [this link](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/) (GitHub repo at [this link](https://github.com/Dunebook/Firebase-auth-chat-app/tree/master/src)). The project is for a real-time chat app, but some of the key structural features could be useful for any web app with authentication, dynamic pages, etc. I followed along with the steps of the tutorial to create the project myself and learn about the interaction between React and Firebase. I have attained permission to use any and all of the code in a personal or commercial manner. Anyone can view the current build of the project at [this link](https://test-app-41adc.web.app/chat) (hosted on Firebase).

# To the Spot-Me dev team:
Please take a look around, I think the file structure of this project makes a lot of sense for our own web app. Also take a look at App.js in the src folder to get an idea of how we can manage publicly and privately available routes within the web app. The Chat.js file in the src/pages/ folder demonstrates how we can read from and write to the Firebase Realtime Database (although we may end up using the Firebase Firestore database instead) which allows for the updating of component state in real-time. Clearly, we will need different pages, CSS styling, and database documents, but I think the general structure of this app is something we can build off of.
